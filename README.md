## unitime - Simple Day Journal application

A day journal application that tries to eschew metric time to look at days in a more holistic approach. It is inspired by hermits, who live in solitude in search of meaning, fulfillment, and often, a spiritual search. Users record their day in terms of the aspects of self they worked on and the relative amount of time spent doing such tasks. The data is visualized in various scales and can be studied in aggregate.
